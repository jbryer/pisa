### Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)

The [Programme for International Student Assessment](http://www.pisa.oecd.org) (PISA) is an international study conducted by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. This R package provides R friendly versions of the following four data sets:

* Student results which include the student background questionnaire as well as the outcomes of the math, science, and reading assessments (`data(pisa.student)`)
* School results from the school questionnaire (`data(pisa.school)`)
* Parent results from the parent questionnaire (`data(pisa.parent)`)
* The detailed item results from the cognitive assessments (`data(pisa.items)`)

Here are some useful resources for getting started with PISA:

The OECD allows for redistribution of their data as indicated in the [Product License](http://www.pisa.oecd.org/dataoecd/59/50/47307726.pdf) (this license is also included in the `inst` directory of the package). Please read and adhere to this license. This R package is provided as-is but every effort has been made to ensure that the quality of the included datasets are equivalent to that provided by OECD. The R data files were created from the original data files with the SPSS syntax files for proper data conversions.
